# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in route handlers that interact with databases.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling for scenarios such as database connection failures or cases where the requested user doesn't exist.  The current implementation only logs errors to the console, which is insufficient for production applications. This can lead to application crashes or cryptic 500 error responses to clients. 

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It includes comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks and appropriate HTTP status codes to communicate errors effectively to clients. It also demonstrates how to provide more meaningful error messages.
